 Manual Inhibition - an online experiment on mobile devices

Concept by Clara Kuper and Martin Rolfs
Code by Clara Kuper

In this repository, I collect experimental code and analysis code for a psychophysical study run on mobile touchscreen devices. A detailed explanation of the project will soon be made available here: https://osf.io/fs985/

Please note, the code I host here does not run on it\'92s own. The experiment requires the jsPsych toolbox and the analysis in python requires some packages to be installed. 

If you want to use this code and have any questions, please contact Clara Kuper (clara.kuper@student.hu-berlin.de)}
